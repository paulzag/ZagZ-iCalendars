# ZagZ iCalendars

A series of useful iCalendar files.

## Easter-iCalendar
An iCalendar file containing Good Friday, Holy Saturday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday.

There are many pages on the internet that will tell you when Easter is this year or next or even out to whenever you want. I could not find an .ics file to import into a calendar that listed the 4 days of Easter that are public holidays in New South Wales Australia.

So I made one for the covering 1900 to 2300. I then made a more smaller file covering 2020-2050

This is part of a larger project to create public holiday iCalendar files for Sydney, New South Wales, Australia and other states of Australia.
